## Error Codes

- **400 Bad Request:**
  - If a session is full when trying to join.
  - If the `player_name` is not provided when creating or joining a session.

- **404 Not Found:**
  - If the session with the given `session_name` does not exist (in `GET`, `DELETE`, or `PATCH` requests).

- **500 Internal Server Error:**
  - If thereâ€™s a problem with the server processing the request.

### Notes:

- Each session has a unique 5-character `session_name` generated upon creation.
- Player names and session data (scores, turns) are updated dynamically as users interact with the session.
- Player 1 starts the session, and Player 2 can join if the session isn't full.
